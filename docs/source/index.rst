bayes_spec
==========

`bayes_spec` is a framework for user-defined, cloud-based models of astrophysical systems (e.g., the interstellar medium) that enables spectral line simulation and statistical inference. Built in the `pymc probabilistic programming library <https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html>`_, `bayes_spec` uses Monte Carlo Markov Chain techniques to fit user-defined models to data. The user-defined models can be a simple line profile (e.g., a Gaussian profile) or a complicated physical model. The models are "cloud-based", meaning there can be multiple "clouds" or "components" each with a unique set of the model parameters. `bayes_spec` includes algorithms to estimate the optimal number of components in a given dataset.

Useful information can be found in the `Github repository <https://github.com/tvwenger/bayes_spec>`_ and in the tutorials below.
